# Tabete

👋 Why “Tabete”?

It’s a fusion of our team’s initials and a subtle nod to a Japanese expression.

We believe in openness and transparency. Every idea, solution, and opportunity is openly explored and shared.

te (from “tabete” 食べて): In Japanese, “tabete” means “please eat.” It’s an invitation, a welcoming gesture. By including this element, we’re extending a metaphorical invitation for you to join us at the table, to partake in the feast of ideas, creativity, and collaboration we offer.

In essence, Tabete represents an open invitation to collaborate, to nourish ideas, and to grow together. It’s about feeding innovation, fuelling connections, and making sure that everyone has a place — at our table and on our team.

## Kotatsu

A kotatsu is a traditional Japanese heated table, a place where people gather to share warmth, meals, and conversations. It’s a symbol of comfort, connection, and togetherness.

In the spirit of Tabete, Kotatsu represents our shared space — a welcoming environment where ideas are exchanged, creativity is nurtured, and collaboration thrives. Just as a kotatsu brings people together, our platform is designed to foster a sense of community and belonging.

Here, at our Kotatsu, we invite you to join us in sharing the feast of innovation and collaboration. It’s a place where everyone has a seat, and every voice is valued. Together, let’s create something meaningful and impactful.

Welcome to sit down with us.
