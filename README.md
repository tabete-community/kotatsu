It’s a fusion of our team’s initials and a subtle nod to a Japanese expression.

We believe in openness and transparency. Every idea, solution, and opportunity is openly explored and shared.

**Tabete** (たべて, 食べて) means “please eat” in Japanese. It’s an invitation, a welcoming gesture. By including this element, we’re extending a metaphorical invitation for you to join us at the table, to partake in the feast of ideas, creativity, and collaboration we offer.

In essence, **Tabete represents an open invitation** to collaborate, to nourish ideas, and to grow together. It’s about feeding innovation, fuelling connections, and making sure that everyone has a place — at our table and on our team.

## Kotatsu

A **kotatsu** (こたつ, 炬燵) is a traditional Japanese heated table, a place where people gather to share warmth, meals, and conversations. It’s a symbol of comfort, connection, and togetherness.

In the spirit of Tabete, **Kotatsu represents our shared space** — a welcoming environment where ideas are exchanged, creativity is nurtured, and collaboration thrives. Just as a kotatsu brings people together, our platform is designed to foster a sense of community and belonging.

Here, at our Kotatsu, we invite you to join us in sharing the feast of innovation and collaboration. It’s a place where everyone has a seat, and every voice is valued. Together, let’s create something meaningful and impactful.

## Irori

An **irori** (いろり, 囲炉裏) is the sunken hearth found at the centre of older Japanese homes.
It’s where meals are simmered, tea is brewed, tools are forged, and stories are traded long after the flames fade to embers.

In the Tabete Community, **Irori is our creative forge** – a place where we
prototype wild ideas before they’re “production-ready”, refine skills side-by-side
through pair-coding, sketching, hacking or soldering, and keep the communal fire
burning by sharing knowledge as soon as it sparks.

Welcome to sit down with us. Pull up a cushion at the hearth, add your own fuel to the flames, and help shape whatever we build next.
