It’s a fusion of our team’s initials and a subtle nod to a Japanese expression.

We believe in openness and transparency. Every idea, solution, and opportunity is openly explored and shared.

**Tabete** (たべて, 食べて) means “please eat” in Japanese. It’s an invitation, a welcoming gesture. By including this element, we’re extending a metaphorical invitation for you to join us at the table, to partake in the feast of ideas, creativity, and collaboration we offer.

In essence, **Tabete represents an open invitation** to collaborate, to nourish ideas, and to grow together. It’s about feeding innovation, fuelling connections, and making sure that everyone has a place — at our table and on our team.

## Kotatsu

A **kotatsu** (こたつ, 炬燵) is a traditional Japanese heated table, a place where people gather to share warmth, meals, and conversations. It’s a symbol of comfort, connection, and togetherness.

In the spirit of Tabete, **Kotatsu represents our shared space** — a welcoming environment where ideas are exchanged, creativity is nurtured, and collaboration thrives. Just as a kotatsu brings people together, our platform is designed to foster a sense of community and belonging.

Here, at our Kotatsu, we invite you to join us in sharing the feast of innovation and collaboration. It’s a place where everyone has a seat, and every voice is valued. Together, let’s create something meaningful and impactful.

## Shichirin

A **shichirin (しちりん, 七輪)** is a compact charcoal grill you break out for yakitori,
roasted sweet‑potatoes, or late‑night balcony barbecues. You fire it up only
when needed, share the sizzle, then let the coals cool.

Inside the Tabete Community, **Shichirin is our pop‑up test kitchen** – the space
for rapid prototypes and quick experiments. We spark an idea, grill it together
while it’s hot, taste, tweak, and move on.

Pull up your skewer, throw something on the grill, and let’s see what flavours
we invent next.
