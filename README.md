## Why Tabete exists

We're a circle of software development consultants who know that sharing time together will hone our craft.
Having met regularly to talk shop for many years, we've noticed a couple of things:

### Osmosis is real

Simply being around peers lets ideas, perspectives and knowledge cross-pollinate. The conversations and showcases in our meetings aren't just theoretical; they spark inspiration and encourage us to explore implementing fresh ideas in our own clients' environments.

### A tether prevents tunnel vision

Deep immersion with a client is useful, but it can blur objectivity. Regular check-ins with the community pull us out of the weeds, let us test assumptions with the group and help us spot root causes instead of normalising work-arounds.

### Hire one, get a team

When bringing a Tabete consultant on board, you're not getting a lone consultant - you're gaining the reach, ideas and experience of the entire Tabete Community.
