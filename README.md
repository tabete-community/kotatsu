## Why the Tabete Community exists

We’re a circle of hands-on consultants who knows that sharing time together will make us better at our craft.
Having done regular check-ups with other consultants for many years, we've noticed a couple of things:

**Osmosis is real.**<br/>
Simply being around a group of peers lets ideas, perspectives and knowledge cross-pollinate. The conversations in our meetings or when one shows something they’ve done for their client aren’t just theoretical; they spark inspiration and encourage us to explore how to implement those ideas in our clients' environments.

**A tether prevents tunnel vision.**<br/>
Deep immersion with a client is useful, but it can blur objectivity. Regular check-ins with the community pull us out of the weeds, let us test assumptions with the group and help us spot root causes instead of normalising work-arounds.

**Hire one, get a team.**<br/>
When you invite one of us into your organisation, you’re not hiring a lone consultant - you’re gaining the reach, ideas, and curiosity of the entire Tabete Community.
