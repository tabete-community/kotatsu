</p>

**Tabete** (たべて, 食べて) means "please eat" in Japanese.
It's an invitation, a welcoming gesture.

In essence, **Tabete itself represents an invitation** to join us at our table, to collaborate, and to grow together.
It's about feeding innovation, fuelling connections and making sure that everyone has a place - at our table and on our team.

## Kotatsu

</p>

A **kotatsu** (こたつ, 炬燵) is a traditional Japanese heated table, a place where people gather to share warmth, meals and conversations.
It's a symbol of comfort, connection and togetherness.

At Tabete, **Kotatsu represents our shared space**.
A welcoming environment where ideas, struggles and updates are shared regularly.
Just as a kotatsu brings people together, our regular meets foster a sense of community and belonging.

## Shichirin

</p>

A **shichirin** (しちりん, 七輪) is a compact charcoal grill you break out for yakitori, roasted sweet‑potatoes, or late‑night balcony barbecues.

At Tabete, **Shichirin represents our deep dives**.
Where a chat just wouldn't suffice, we go in-depth with a community workshop.
A focus session for exploring promising new ideas or tackling tricky problems.
