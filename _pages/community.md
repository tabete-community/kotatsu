**Tabete** is a circle of friends, consultants and tinkerers who believe work is
richer when it feels like an open table.

**The current crew** is<br>
\- Albert Rigo<br>
\- Bosse Nyström<br>
\- Christian Pendelton<br>
\- PA Lundblad<br>
\- Thierry Lacour.

Pull up your skewer, throw something on the grill, and let’s see what flavours we invent next.
