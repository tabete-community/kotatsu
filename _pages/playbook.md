## Playbook

<p class="brand-wrapper">

</p>

Our playbook isâ€¯just enough structure to keep us intentional.
We're not fans of heavyweight rulebooks, yet we know that having no guard rails breeds inertia and complacency - it's too easy to slip back into old habits and only see what is right in front of you.

We want to stay steadily moving with intent.

## Gatherings

### Kotatsu

Regular after-works where we share ideas, struggles and updates over beverages.
Friends to the community are welcome.

### Shichirin

Workshops where we dive into a specific idea, problem or prototype.

## Ground rules

### Office

- Everyone gets a desk
- Tabete provides a filled fridge

### Making decisions

- Ask two people in a public setting (Discord, etc.) - Ask those that you think might not agree
- For major decisions (like a new member) we need unanimous agreement

### Tooling

- Notion for docs and the backlog
- GitHub for the website
- Discord for online chats and hangouts
