## Playbook

</p>

Our playbook is just enough structure to keep us intentional. We’re not fans of heavyweight rulebooks, yet we know that having no guard‑rails at all breeds inertia and complacency - it’s too easy to slip back into old habits and only see what is right in front of you.

We want to stay curious, generous, and steadily moving with intent.

## Gatherings

**Kotatsu After‑Work** (monthly)<br>
Share warmth, food, and community updates with beverages. Friends to the community are welcome.

**Shichirin Skill‑Grill** (weekly)<br>
Dive into each others work, take turns, focus on one per session -
Swap expertise, solve tough problems, sketch prototypes, look into the future to figure out the "plan".

## Ground rules

**Office**<br>
\- Everyone gets a desk<br>
\- Tabete provides a filled fridge

**Making decisions**<br>
\- Ask two people in a public setting (discord, etc) - ask those that you think might not agree<br>
\- For major decisions (like a new member), then everyone needs to say yes

**Tooling**<br>
\- Notion for docs<br>
\- Github for webpage<br>
\- Discord for chats<br>
\- We should probably have a place for a backlog
