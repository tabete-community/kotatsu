## Playbook

Our playbook is just enough structure to keep us intentional. We’re not fans of heavyweight rulebooks, yet we know that having no guard‑rails at all breeds inertia and complacency - it’s too easy to slip back into old habits and only see what is right in front of you.

We want to stay curious, generous, and steadily moving with intent.

## Gatherings

**Kotatsu After‑Work** (monthly)<br>
Share warmth, food, and community updates with beverages. Friends to the community are welcome.

**Shichirin food tasting** (weekly)<br>
Dive into each others work, take turns, focus on one per session -
Swap expertise, solve tough problems, sketch prototypes, look into the future to figure out the "plan".
