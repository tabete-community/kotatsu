## Playbook

</p>

Our playbook is just enough structure to keep us intentional.
We're not fans of heavyweight rulebooks, yet we know that having no guard‑rails at all breeds inertia and complacency - it's too easy to slip back into old habits and only see what is right in front of you.

We want to stay curious, generous and steadily moving with intent.

## Gatherings

### Kotatsu After‑Work
Share warmth, food and community updates with beverages.
Friends to the community are welcome.

### Shichirin Skill‑Grill
Dive into each others work, take turns, focus on one per session.
Swap expertise, solve tough problems, sketch prototypes, look into the future to figure out the "plan".

## Ground rules

### Office
- Everyone gets a desk
- Tabete provides a filled fridge

### Making decisions
- Ask two people in a public setting (discord, etc) - ask those that you think might not agree
- For major decisions (like a new member), then everyone needs to say yes

### Tooling
- Notion for docs
- Github for webpage
- Discord for chats
- We should probably have a place for a backlog
