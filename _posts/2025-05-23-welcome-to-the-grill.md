## We're back in business

The stars finally aligned, the opportunity is here and the gang is back together again.

As consultants for many years with different customers, we have always been talking and helping each other out, the conversations while eating the best dumplings from **Fengsson Dumpling House** or *"husmanskost"* from **Swedish Express**. We thought that we should formalise this and try to extend our family so to say.
As luck (or maybe planned opportunity) would have it, all five of us were available to start this right now.

This isn't fastfood; the **Tabete** concept has simmered like a ramen broth, building flavour slowly.
Each ingredient comes from decades of combined experience in what separates a consultant who creates valuable change from one who simply fills a seat.

Our goal is to become better at our craft, so that our customers can get that extra value from us while at the same time have fun and eat excellent food.

If that sounds tasty, pull up a cushion, subscribe to the feed and keep an eye on the embers. First proper story lands soon.

*A lot of food metaphors... Clearly time for lunch...*
