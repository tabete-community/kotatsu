## The debut kotatsu

Here's a quick look back on our first "kotatsu" (our cozy meetups): Ulrik's presentation on AI and LLMs.

Starting with a big thank you to Ulrik for stepping up and delivering a genuinely fascinating presentation on a contentious topic, as well as to all who were present for it and the discussions it sparked.
It was a great start to what we hope to be a lengthy and thriving series of small community gatherings on a variety of industry topics.

For those who missed out; Ulrik's presented the past, present and possible futures of AI/LLMs while delving into their technical depths.
It was a grounded delivery far from the evangelical praise and pessimistic dismissal that so commonly dominate the topic.
Between the great presentation and numerous discussions along the way, everyone - enthusiasts and skeptics alike - left more informed and having had a lot of fun.

Taking a look at the format; For our debut event, it was everything we had hoped for.
Our goal with Tabete is to maintain a small community of friends in the industry; people we enjoy regularly talking shop with.
The idea of a community member presenting and discussing their findings with a small group of familiars was an enticing one.
To us, Friday's cozy atmosphere and great discussions prove the idea has legs, and is distinct from the average industry meetup.
However, you're as much part of the community as we are, so we'd love to hear your opinions and ideas as well, so reach out!

With all that said, we wish you all a great end of the year, and hope to see you at our next event - news to follow - in the new year.

All the best,
<br>Thierry & Tabete friends
